# Image-Processing-API
>## _Project one of my Udacity nanodegree_

## **1. Setup and configuration**
To use this API, first run the command below to install `node_modules`
```bash
npm i
```

Then check the `package.json` file for the **dependencies** and **devDependencies** used, and install them accordingly as follows.
```bash
npm i express jasmine jasmine-spec-reporter morgan sharp supertest
npm i --save-dev typescript ts-node prettier nodemon eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @types/supertest @types/sharp @types/node @types/morgan @types/jasmine @types/express
```
The `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.json` files are already configured for you.

## **2. Testing**
Once you're done with that, run the predefined tests using the command below, to check if the API works.
```bash
npm run test
```
## **3. Running the application**
When all tests pass, run either of these commands to start the application.
```bash
npm run start
OR
node build/.
```

This will log a message to the terminal that the server has started.
```bash
Server started at http://localhost:3000
```

Open your browser to that address, and you'll be greeted with a welcome message.

Edit the URL, using the format below.


> http://localhost:3000/convert?/fileName=name_of_image_in_assets&width=sample_width&height=sample_height

![Image Example](assets/images/url.jpg)

Using the exact same url above, you'll later on see an image similar to this one below.

Try it out with different widths and heights and enjoy the process ðŸ˜Š.

## **Have fun!**
